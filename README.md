# Road-Accidents-Dashboard-using-excel

In this project, I've developed an Excel-based dashboard to analyze road accidents data for the years 2021 and 2022. Utilizing advanced data refinement and visualization techniques, the dashboard offers comprehensive insights into accident trends and contributing factors.

Key Components:

Data Refinement: Ensure accuracy and reliability of accident data through rigorous data refinement and manipulation.
Data Visualization: Present accident trends effectively using a variety of graphical representations such as charts, graphs, and maps.
Insightful Analysis: Uncover prevailing patterns and contributing variables driving road accidents through skillful data visualization.
Comprehensive Understanding: Gain a holistic understanding of road safety dynamics across 2021 and 2022 by amalgamating data cleaning, processing, and visualization.
